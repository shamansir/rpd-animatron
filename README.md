Animatron Toolkit for RPD-Framework

See http://github.com/shamansir/rpd for RPD Engine code, detailed information and docs.

This README will also be improved at some point, but for now this repo is just a
submodule for http://github.com/shamansir/rpd.

It can be used as an independent toolkit with compiled RPD engine, of course.
